It is is predictive model based on random forest classifier.

In this project we investigated the data, checking for data unbalancing, visualizing the features and understanding the relationship between different features using different libraries like seaborn, matplotlib and thus understand the relations between different features and how they effect target values.


We started with RandomForrestClassifier, for which we obtained an AUC scode of 0.65. For the RandomForrestClassifier we also experimented with OneHotEncoder, replacing the categorical features with dummified values (introducing one dummy variable for each category. With the dummified features, the improvement of the AUC score was also  quite small.
